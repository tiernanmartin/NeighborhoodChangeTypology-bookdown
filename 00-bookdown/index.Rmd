Futurewise would like to thank King County Public Health and the Communities of Opportunity Program for their generous support, which made this project possible.

The authors would like to thank the staff members of the White Center Community Development Association for their valuable insights and critiques of the project throughout its timeline. They would also like to thank the following King County staff for their guidance and support: Andrea Akita, Public Health; Kim Tippens, Public Health; Kirsten Wysen, Public Health; Kristin Moore, Public Health; Cheryl Markham, Department of Community and Human Services; and Christie Most at the King County Assessor’s office.

Additional gratitude is extended to the members of the COO Evaluation and Advisory Data Workgroup who provided feedback on the project and to all of the community members who contributed to the project by participating in workshops in the Fall of 2016. Without the guidance of community members and community-based organizations this project would not have been possible.

The White Center CDA works to eradicate poverty and build a vibrant, economically diverse community.

  - Facilitating a community-driven agenda for change
  - Connecting families and community members to resources, services, and supports
  - Advocating for inclusion, engagement and resident leadership
  - Working across communities, cultures and systems
The WCCDA is committed to ensuring long-term equity and social justice through systems change for the benefit of the White Center community.

The White Center CDA made invaluable contributions to learning process and development of this research. The collaboration between Futurewise and WCCDA was instrumental in enabling the project team to unpack the limitations of research methods that fail to involve community members, as well as the importance of supporting communities in the struggle to control their own data. WCCDA provided crucial guidance to the project team’s search for indicators that better represent the experience of communities like White Center.
