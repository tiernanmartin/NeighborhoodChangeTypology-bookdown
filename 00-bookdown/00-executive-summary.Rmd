# Executive Summary {-}

## Background {-}

Gentrification and displacement shape the neighborhoods of King County, Washington's cities and unincorporated urban communities in profound and comlpex ways. While many parts of America struggle to overcome depopulation and disinvestment, over the past two decades the residents of King County have experienced a set of challenges that come with growth: rising costs of living, ballooning commute times, and housing costs that have grown much faster than most incomes [@king_county_2016_2016]. Gentrification - a term that generally refers to the alteration of a neighborhood's character in response to changes in the socioeconomic makeup of its residents, the appreciation of real estate values, and new investment by public and private actors - has occurred in many of King County's neighborhoods during this period of regional growth. While the revitalization of neighborhoods that suffer the costs of persistent poverty is an outcome worth pursuing, it is unfortunately the case that throughout history many such efforts have instead lead to the displacement of the residents and businesses from these neighborhoods.

The goal of this project is to provide a clearer understanding of which neighborhoods in King County are experiencing gentrification or are at-risk of gentrifying. The project's partners envision that this information will be used by community members and community-serving organizations in these neighborhoods as they demand displacement mitigation and community restoration policies from their local governments.

## Key Findings {-}

  1. **The people from the communities most impacted by inequities are the ones who best understand the challenges that they face. They must, therefore, play a meaningful role in deciding what solutions to pursue.**<br><br>
  2. **Over 30% of the Countyâ€™s neighborhoods are either experiencing gentrification or are susceptible to it.**<br><br>
  3. **The vast majority of Communities of Opportunity (COO) neighborhoods show signs of gentrification but the specific stages of gentrification vary.**<br><br>
  4. **Each COO community has at least one neighborhood undergoing the "dynamic" stage of gentrification that is associated with on-going involuntary displacement.**<br><br>


## How to Use This Report {-}

The results of this project should be interpreted and used with caution. 

As the project team learned early on in the process, the neighborhood types do not represent the experience of everyone in each neighborhood. Further, the data that inform the results all contain some degree of uncertainty and, therefore, should be treated as estimates rather than exact representations of reality. But most importantly, the results should be understood as imperfect attempts to simplify a complex socioeconomic process in order to identify appropriate public policy solutions.^[The 20th century statistician George Box is commonly attributed for coining the phase "All models are wrong but some are useful", an aphorism that applies to this project and its findings. See the #limitations section for a detailed list of the challenges that are inherent to this project, its method, and its findings.] The data that are publicly available for each neighborhood reflect the priorities of the public institutions that collect data (e.g., US Census, King County Tax Assessor's Office, etc.) and therefore some important indicators (like recent market-rate rent prices) are not available. Data are not neutral; they reflect societal power dynamics, especially when it comes to the question of which data are collected (and published) and which are not [@coalition_of_communities_of_color_leading_2018; @jolivette_research_2015; @townsend_cities_2015]. 

This report makes use of a relatively small set of indicators from public data sources in order to describe gentrification in an actionable way. **The results of this project should be interpreted not as definitive facts but rather as systematically-derived starting points for discussions between impacted communities and policymakers.** The findings of this project cannot be used as a substitute for direct engagement with impacted communities but they may help contextualize such efforts and point toward potential solutions.
