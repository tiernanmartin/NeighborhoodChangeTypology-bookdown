# Methods

## The Portland Model

This project begins with the method developed by Dr. Lisa Bates in partnership with the City of Portland, OR. As described by @bates_gentrification_2013 [p.59], 

> The typology assessment began with a retrospective look at neighborhood change in Portland to assess whether a small number of measured indicators could represent the changes observed today. … Measured indicators were chosen to represent the “robust, yet parsimonious” approach and to align with policy-relevant metrics (such as HUD income standards for housing assistance).

This approach uses the neighborhood (approximated by census tracts) as the unit of analysis, which was part of the reason it appealed to the project team.

Additionally, the method provides a clear conceptual structure to the process of neighborhood change. This structure is a three-level hierarchy^[While the project author characterizes Dr. Bates’ conceptual model as a hierarchy, Bates herself does not use that term in her report] and it enables Bates to develop definitions and assign “measured indicators” to them. 

The structure's levels are:

  1. **Statuses:** Long-term low cost/low income; at-risk or gentrifying; long-term high cost/high income
  2. **Stages (of neighborhood change):** Early-, Mid-, and Late-stage
  3. **Types (of neighborhood change):** Susceptible, Early Type 1, Early Type 2, Dynamic, Late, and Continued Loss

The diagram below illustrates how elements of this hierarchical conceptual structure relate:

### Statuses {-}

A neighborhood’s status simply describes whether or not it is considered to be at-risk for gentrification or not. Neighborhoods that experience long-term disinvestment and poverty face many challenges but the threat of gentrification only applies when these conditions are combined with a housing market that begins to rapidly appreciate in value. Similarly, a long-term high cost neighborhood may experience home value appreciation but without a shift toward higher-income and highly-educated residents this case doesn’t fit the model of gentrification. The characteristics of a gentrifying or gentrified neighborhood are “housing market changes, economic status changes, and demographic changes … that alter its character” [@bates_gentrification_2013, p.9].

### Stages {-}

The stages of gentrification describe the changes that are occurring at a high level. Early-stage neighborhoods are at-risk or just beginning to show the signs of gentrification; Mid-stage neighborhoods are experiencing active gentrification pressures; and Late-stage neighborhoods have already progressed from low housing market value to high and have little or none of the previous community left.

Bates connects each stage to a set of policies and strategies that communities can advocate for. This connection between the conceptual model and potential solutions is significant strength of Dr. Bates’ method.

### Types {-}

The six types in the Neighborhood Change Typology represent the full spectrum of possibilities for at-risk and gentrifying neighborhoods. While a given neighborhood could (in theory) progress through all six stages linearly, the typology does presume that to be the case; change happens at different rates and in different “flavors” in different neighborhoods. 

### Dimensions of Neighborhood Change {-}

The characteristics of a neighborhood that determine its type are called the "dimensions". The dimensions of neighborhood change include:

  1. **Vulnerability to Housing Displacement:** whether the neighborhoods residents have relatively high percentages of groups that have historically been less able to resist displacement pressure. These groups include: 
      a. People of color^[Throughout US history, racist actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals have forced people who aren’t white to live in certain neighborhoods. Examples of these types of actions - including the redlining of communities of color, the placement of racially restrictive covenants on property deeds, and the physical degradation (or destruction) of people of color neighborhoods in pursuit of public infrastructure projects - are present in the history of many places in King County and elsewhere [see @taylor_forging_1994; @chin_seattles_2001]. While a person’s race or ethnicity should not (in theory) make them any more or less vulnerable to displacement, the legacy of systemic racism has significant, inter-generational negative influence on the lives of people of color [@chetty_race_2018] and therefore this project treats race as an indicator of vulnerability to displacement.]
      b. Adults with less formal education (less than a Bachelor's degree)
      c. Low-income households
      d. Renter households
  
  2. **Demographic Changes:** whether there is a relatively large change in multiple demographic groups. These are the groups that have historically been more able to resist displacement pressure and more likely to participate in neighborhood change as gentrifiers. They include:
      a. White people
      b. Adults with more formal education (a Bachelor's degree or higher)
      c. Medium/high-income households
      d. Owner households
      
  3. **Housing Market Appreciation:** whether the neighborhoods housing market is shifting from a low value state to high value. Bates measures this change using the home values themselves (in comparison to all neighborhoods) and the rate of change in these values (i.e., appreciation) [@bates_gentrification_2013, p.28]. The Housing Market Appreciation dimension of neighborhood change can itself be divided into types:
      a. **Adjacent neighborhoods:** low/moderate value neighborhoods with low appreciation rates that are next to high value or rapidly appreciating neighborhoods^[The Adjacent type is intended to capture the "spillover effect" where the proximity to high value markets draws buyers to a nearby low value neighborhood [see @bates_gentrification_2013, p.61]]
      b. **Accelerating neighborhoods:** low/moderate value neighborhoods with high appreciation rates
      c. **Appreciated neighborhoods:** high value neighborhoods that appreciated from low value status over a longer period of time


## The (Revised) Communinities of Opportunity Model

The model that Dr. Bates developed for the City of Portland served as a foundation for this project and for many others.^[see @city_of_seattle_seattle_2016] However, given that this approach uses a limited number of indicators to capture a complex process, it is necessary to adapt the method slightly to fit the context in which it is applied.^[When developing the model for Portland, Dr. Bates began with a “retrospective look” at neighborhood change in that city and this process informed the selection of indicators; see @bates_gentrification_2013 [p.59]] After considering the context of King County and receiving constructive criticism of the preliminary model, the project team decided to implement the following adaptations to the Portland model:

  1. **Use the most recent data available**
  2. **Add indicators of housing market appreciation** that might capture faster rates of change
  3. Where possible, **make a distinction between the experience of renter and homeowner households** (note: this goal was not fully achieved)
  
### Most Recent Data {-}

The Portland model uses data from the two sources: the US Census^[The sources of the US Census data used in the Portland model include both the American Community Survey and the Decennial Census] and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS). The vulnerability indicators used the most recent 5-year spans while the indicators of demographic change and housing market appreciation used decadal samples.

In contrast, the COO Revised Model uses data from one additional data source (the King County Tax Assessor’s Office) and uses the most recent data from that source as well as the US Census. For example, instead of comparing the change in the percentage of white households between 2000 and 2010, the model compares the two most-recent (non-overlapping) 5-year spans: 2007-2011 and 2013-2017^[Note: the 2008-2012 5-year span could have been used but the project team decided not to because the potential increase in recency didn’t outweigh the cost of revising the data processing code. This change could be made to future improvements of the model.] The indicators that rely on data from the tax assessor use shorter, more recent time periods than the Census-based indicators. 

### Appreciation Indicators {-}

While the Portland model relied on US Census surveys responses, the COO Revised model primarily uses data from the King County Tax Assessor. The tax assessor data captures the entirety of the County’s housing properties and the valuations are updated regularly according to the  County’s algorithm. Additionally, this data includes all sales of housing properties along with relevant metadata like the sale price, the size of the home, and the “instrument” of the sale (e.g., foreclosure, divorce settlement, etc.)^[See the metadata for the ‘Real Property Sales’ file listed on King County’s Assessor Data Portal: <https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/datadownload/desc/Real%20Property%20Sales.doc>].

In addition to adding a source of more recent housing market data, this project deviates from the Portland model by using multiple indicators in the definition of each housing market appreciation type. For instance, a neighborhood with a “High” 2018 value may either have a high median assessed value or a high median sale price per square foot (both measures are relative to all census tracts in King County). Similarly, this project adds a measurement of the percentage of homes sold in a neighborhood in the past three years as an alternate indicator of a “hot”/appreciating market. The inspiration for this additional appreciation indicator comes from Bates’ recommendations for the “monitoring and tracking” of new market sales activity [@bates_gentrification_2013, p.35]. The COO Revised Model refers to this sale rate indicator as “short-term” appreciation and the home value indicator as “medium-term” appreciation, but the presence of a high value in either indicator is interpreted by the model as an “appreciating” housing market type.

### The Renter Experience {-}

The Portland model includes housing tenure (i.e., whether a household owns or rents their home) in the Vulnerability and Demographic Change dimensions of neighborhood change. However, its Housing Market Appreciation dimension does not include rent prices. Home rent prices are challenging data to obtain both because there is no systematic requirement that landlords disclose rent prices publicly and because they change dynamically in response to the local housing market. An argument could be made that rent prices are loosely correlated with the values of owner-occupied homes, so using only the latter data will still capture most of the housing market conditions for a given neighborhood. 

Nevertheless, this project made an effort to include rent prices in the Housing Market Appreciation dimension of neighborhood change. This decision was made after receiving feedback during all three of the “ground-truthing” workshops and from the project’s partners at the White Center Community Development Association that rent prices in this region are growing at a rate that leaves many working class and low income households with no choice but to move away from their neighborhoods. 

The project team tried to identify a reliable source of rental prices for King County but was unsuccessful in this effort.^[Similar projects like @city_of_seattle_seattle_2016 used data from the now-closed market research firm Dupre and Scott. Other data sources that are currently available do not provide data at the census tract geographic scale.] Instead, data from the American Community Survey 5-year spans was included in the model although it does not meet the projects requirements for “freshness” (i.e., rents change too dynamically to use a sample of survey responses collected over the span of five years).

Finally, this model makes a distinction between neighborhoods that are predominantly multifamily housing markets and those that are either mostly single family or mixed markets. The primary reason for this change is that several of King County’s census tracts are almost entirely^[A simple analysis of the share of housing units in multifamily buildings (by census tract) led the project team to select >=90% as the threshold for determining that a tract should be considered “mostly multifamily”] composed of multifamily homes and therefore the use of median single family home values as an indicator of market appreciation would yield inaccurate results. Instead, the COO Revised model uses a combination of rent prices and residential condominium values and sale prices for these neighborhoods. This allows the model to more accurately describe the stage of gentrification for neighborhoods located near central business districts (primarily Seattle’s CBD) while avoiding the inadvertent "erasure" of the experience of these neighborhoods' residents.

## Model Comparison

The following table captures the similarities and difference between the Portland model and this project's adaptation of it. The primary distinctions between the COO Revised model and the Portland model are the use of more recent data, the addition of alternative indicators of housing market appreciation, and the divison of the model between neighborhoods with mostly multifamily housing and those characterized by eithr mostly single family or a mixture of housing types.

## Limitations

This method is intended to guide policy makers and community members toward effective displacement mitigation strategies by categorizing neighborhoods according to their stage in the process of neighborhood change. As with any approach that attempts to model a complex system (in this case, a neighborhood), the results of this method should be interpreted cautiously and its limitations must be acknowledged.^[For a relevant summary of the limitations of displacement risk composite indices, see @city_of_seattle_seattle_2016 [p.15] ]

**The most important limitation is the absence of contextual information.** Simply put, if a neighborhood is experiencing gentrification and displacement but those changes are not captured in Census/Assessor’s Office data then this model will be wrong because it only “knows about” a small set of indicators. This method does not include a way to add contextual data from the communities that are being displaced to refine its typology classification. If used to inform public policy, the model’s results should _complement_ the results of direct community engagement - not replace them.

**The use of small geographic units (e.g., census tracts) increases the uncertainty of the data.** While there appears to be some consensus in the academic scholarship that gentrification is a neighborhood-based dynamic [@miriam_zuk_gentrification_2015], the use of neighborhood-sized samples of American Community Survey data introduces significant statistical uncertainty into the results. Similarly, the use of data collected during wide spans of time (five years for the ACS data) restricts the ability of the model to reflect current on-the-ground conditions. This limitation is particularly relevant to highly dynamic indicators like rent prices. 

**This method produces _descriptive_ - not predictive - results.** The results describe the demographic and housing market pattern of neighborhoods; they do not predict the precise number of households that might be displaced, nor do they directly measure the number of households that have been displaced already.

**The absence of recent, systematically collected rent price data weakens the model’s ability to accurately portray changes in rental housing markets.** While the project team tried to find a better source of rent data than the ACS, that effort was ultimately unsuccessful. The procurement of rent price data (past and present) for the entirety of King County is beyond the scope of this project.

**The model narrowly focuses on indicators of residential neighborhood change but businesses experience gentrification and displacement pressure as well.** The results should not be interpreted as evidence of changes in the composition of a neighborhood’s business community [@bates_gentrification_2013, p.64].^[@bates_gentrification_2013 [p.64] mentions the potential for conducting a “neighborhood-serving business analysis” using data from the US Census Bureau’s North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)]
